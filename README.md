MERN Stack Front To Back

#Description

This repo relates to Brad Traversy's  "MERN Stack Front To Back" course. 

In this course we will build an in depth full stack social network application using Node.js, Express, React, Redux and MongoDB along with ES6+. We will start with a bank text editor and end with a deployed full stack application. This course includes...

Building an extensive backend API with Node.js & Express
Protecting routes/endpoints with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Extensive API testing with Postman
Integrating React with our backend in an elegant way, creating a great workflow
Building our frontend to work with the API
Using Redux for app state management
Creating reducers and actions for our resources
Creating many container components that integrate with Redux
Testing with the Redux Chrome extension
Creating a build script, securing our keys and deploy to Heroku using Git
This is NOT an "Intro to React" or "Intro to Node" course. It is a practical hands on course for building an app using the incredible MERN stack. I do try and explain everything as I go so it is possible to follow without React/Node experience but it is recommended that you know at least the basics first.
